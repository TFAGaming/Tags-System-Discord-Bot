# Tags System Discord Bot (version 2.0)
A bot that allows you and your server members to create tags and share them to the public or make them private for them only! (Bot especially for programming servers). The project is made with javascript, [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js), and with my package [super-djs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/super-djs). The bot can support multiple servers but you need to have a super big MongoDB URI database! If you are using a free cluster, I suggest you to use your bot only in **one** server, and not for other servers.

# Setup
## Dependencies installation:
Run the command below in your IDE's shell or terminal to install all the required packages:

```shell
npm i discord.js@14 discord.js-v14-helper fs mathjs mongoose ms node-fetch@cjs os super-djs
```

## Start the project:
The setup for now is for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users only. If you are a repl.it user and non-beginner programmer, you can read the setup below but you have to edit the Environment processing for MongoDB and the bot token.
- 1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- 2. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- 3. Open command propmt (WIND ICON + R â†’ "cmd") and then type `node -v`. If it responds with a version v"16.9.0" or above, you're OK to continue to the next step.
- 4. [Download the project](https://github.com/TFAGaming/Tags-System-Discord-Bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the folder from .zip folder to a normal folder.
- 5. Open the folder on a new VSCode tab.
- 6. Go to `config` folder and edit the properties of each file. (I made a configuration organized)
- 7. Open terminal and then type `node index.js` or `node .`.
- 8. Enjoy.
