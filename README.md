# Tags System Discord Bot (version 2.0)
A bot that allows you and your server members to create tags and share them to the public or make them private for them only! (Bot especially for programming servers). The project is made with javascript, [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js), and with my package [super-djs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/super-djs). The bot can support multiple servers but you need to have a super big mongodb uri database! If you are using a free cluster, I suggest you to use your bot only in **one** server, and not for other servers.
